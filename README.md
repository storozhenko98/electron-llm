## What Is This? 
This is an implementation of a text2text Xenova-tuned model running in an 
electron.js instance. The point of this is to show that local models are 
packageable into an app to use by non-technical people.  

 ## Intstructions

1. Run `npm install` to get the dependencies. 
2. If you want to try running this through electron, do `npm run start`.
3. If you want to package the app, run `npm run make`
